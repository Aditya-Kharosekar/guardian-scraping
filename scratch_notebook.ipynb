Thank God we made that decision because it helped everywhere. </p> \\n<p>“It’s so much up to him more than it was to other players maybe because he communicates with everybody without really speaking the language. OK, we have the Spanish faction, that’s no problem, they are really close and they helped him so much – Thiago, Fab, Ali, Bobby, all these kind of guys, Adrian is great in these aspects. But he’s really close with Curtis, he’s really close with Harvey – I have no idea how they talk, to be honest. On an emotional basis, they are like this [locks fingers] and they were after a week and it’s really strange. But it’s up to him.” </p>'}}]},\n",

Here’s the incident and Max Rushden’s take.\\nFrom PA Media: David Moyes insists Declan Rice’s foul-mouthed rant during which he accused Europa League referee Jesus Gil Manzano of corruption shows how much West Ham’s players care. Hammers captain Rice was filmed berating the Spanish official in the tunnel after his side suffered semi-final heartbreak at the hands of Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday evening. The Premier League club were denied a first European final in 46 years following a 1-0 loss in Germany, which resulted in a 3-1 aggregate defeat. Rice’s post-match remarks to Manzano were were captured by America TV company Fox Sports, with footage circulating on social media. “Ref, ref, it’s so poor, all night, it’s so bad,” said the England midfielder. “How can you be that bad, honestly? You’ve probably been f****** paid. F****** corruption.” West Ham do not intend to comment on the incident until receiving the referee’s report. Manager Moyes – who was sent-off during the match for kicking a ball at a ball boy – felt it demonstrated the passion within his squad and was also aggrieved at the standard of officiating. “It just shows you how much all the players cared,” the Scotsman said on Friday afternoon. “We all cared very much last night.

We felt as if we had been treated quite badly overall and that is what happens.</p> \\n<p>“If you know about football, everybody is emotional so unless you’re in the heat of it sometimes people don’t understand how it feels.</p> \\n<p>“Last night, we had a group of players who were really connected, trying to win the game and felt it was very difficult under lots of different circumstances.”</p> \\n<p>West Ham had Aaron Cresswell sent off after just 19 minutes at Deutsche Bank Park and conceded the only goal of the evening to Rafael Borre just seven minutes later.</p> \\n<p>Defender Cresswell, who pulled down Jens Petter Hauge as he attempted to go through on goal, was initially shown a yellow card but it was upgraded to a red after a video assistant referee review.</p> \\n<p>Regarding Rice’s behaviour, a West Ham spokesperson said: “The club is aware of the video circulating on social media but will not be commenting further until the referee’s report from the UEFA Europa League semi-final second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt has been considered.”</p>'}}]},\n",

       "      'bodyHtml': '<p><strong>Liverpool v Tottenham Hotspur:</strong> Antonio Conte has been chatting ahead of Tomorrow night’s big match at Anfield and has been dropping some sledgehammer subtle hints about what he’d like Tottenham to do if they want to keep him at White Hart Lane. </p> <p>Conte, who joined Spurs in November, has continually refused to say whether he will be at the club next season, recently revealing that his future will be decided after an end-of-season meeting with chairman Daniel Levy and football managing director Fabio Paratici.</p> <p>He also suggested that the key factor would be whether the club were able to match his ambition and how soon they would give him the tools to get Tottenham challenging for the Premier League title again.</p> <p>Klopp was able to turn Liverpool from a club who had lost their seat at the top table of English and European football to arguably the best team in the world as they pursue an unprecedented quadruple this season.</p> <p>The German has been given time and hefty backing in the transfer market, with key additions Mohamad Salah, Virgil Van Dijk, Alisson Becker, Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz helping propel them to new heights.</p> <p>Conte would love similar backing in north London and said spending money is the only way to guarantee success. “I don’t know but if I was sure this type of situation can happen, I sign, you understand?” he said, upon being asked whether Spurs are in a similar position now to Liverpool were when Klopp took over in 2015. </p> <p>“But also the time for Liverpool was easier than now because when Liverpool started this work with Jurgen, they were a top team but not in a way they are now - so consolidated with an important manager, always the same team, big investment, big money spent on the transfer market. They had also the right space to improve and reach this.</p> <p>“Now, in my opinion, I am talking about this league, it is more difficult because the space is not so big. To reduce this gap, you need to spend a lot of money because you need to buy important players. You have to know this otherwise you cannot reduce this gap and hope always for a miracle.</p> <p>“You need time.

       "      'bodyTextSummary': 'Liverpool v Tottenham Hotspur: Antonio Conte has been chatting ahead of Tomorrow night’s big match at Anfield and has been dropping some sledgehammer subtle hints about what he’d like Tottenham to do if they want to keep him at White Hart Lane. Conte, who joined Spurs in November, has continually refused to say whether he will be at the club next season, recently revealing that his future will be decided after an end-of-season meeting with chairman Daniel Levy and football managing director Fabio Paratici. He also suggested that the key factor would be whether the club were able to match his ambition and how soon they would give him the tools to get Tottenham challenging for the Premier League title again. Klopp was able to turn Liverpool from a club who had lost their seat at the top table of English and European football to arguably the best team in the world as they pursue an unprecedented quadruple this season. The German has been given time and hefty backing in the transfer market, with key additions Mohamad Salah, Virgil Van Dijk, Alisson Becker, Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz helping propel them to new heights. Conte would love similar backing in north London and said spending money is the only way to guarantee success. “I don’t know but if I was sure this type of situation can happen, I sign, you understand?” he said, upon being asked whether Spurs are in a similar position now to Liverpool were when Klopp took over in 2015. “But also the time for Liverpool was easier than now because when Liverpool started this work with Jurgen, they were a top team but not in a way they are now - so consolidated with an important manager, always the same team, big investment, big money spent on the transfer market. They had also the right space to improve and reach this. “Now, in my opinion, I am talking about this league, it is more difficult because the space is not so big. To reduce this gap, you need to spend a lot of money because you need to buy important players. You have to know this otherwise you cannot reduce this gap and hope always for a miracle. “You need time. I think in these seven months, we did a really good job with the club and the opportunity we had also in January to sign two good players for us, to help us, to improve the quality of the team. “I think we did a good job but, for sure, you need time.

That meant there was more space which allowed diminutive technical midfielders who might previously have been bullied out of the game to flourish.</p> \\n<p>Suddenly it became possible for the bigger teams, who were becoming relatively bigger than they ever had been before, to exercise greater control over games than ever before, to worry about manipulating space, Guardiola’s <em>juego de posición</em>, rather than having to scrap for midfield survival. That in turn led to significant discomfort when big sides met and one found itself unable to get the ball. One of the reasons Manchester United players lost discipline in the 2009 Champions League final was a sense of humiliation at having “only” around 40% possession.</p> \\n<p>The following year, Mourinho’s Internazionale would show it was possible to win (or at least to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/28/barcelona-internazionale-champions-league\" title=\"\">lose narrowly enough to win on aggregate</a>) with just 19% possession. Sitting back, holding position, allowing the opposition the ball but only 30 yards or more from goal became a viable way to combat the possession sides. Football began to look at times like handball. But there was another way, which was that promulgated by Klopp, who disliked the passivity of bunkering down, hoping nobody pinged a long-range drive into the top corner or suddenly dribbled past three players to score. That was to press hard and high in a coordinated way and look for turnovers and rapid transitions.</p>'}},\n",

       "  'bodyContent': 'Perhaps what has been most striking about this season from a tactical point of view has been the degree of consensus. Money can skew games and there always remains the possibility of a brilliant player upsetting theory by doing something brilliant, but for those clubs who have a notion of an underlying philosophy of play it’s fairly clear what that looks like: a high offside line, a coordinated press and a capacity to retain possession when required. There has been a tendency to portray Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp as opposite poles, one focused on retaining the ball and one on regaining it. That is not unreasonable, although each has edged towards the other over the past couple of seasons. Perhaps what is most significant is that nobody really questions the axis by which they are judged. The age of attrition, of Greece winning the Euros, of José Mourinho, Rafa Benítez and Alex Ferguson in the Carlos Queiroz years, feels a long time ago.\\nFootball changed in 2008, and not just because that was when Guardiola was appointed manager of Barcelona. Before then the knockout stage of the Champions League had only once yielded more than three goals per game; since then the average has only once dipped below three. It was then that a number of factors came together. Improvements in pitch, kit and ball technology had, for some time, meant that at the highest level a first touch could be taken for granted. The liberalisation of the offside law pushed back defensive lines. Intimidatory tackling had largely been eliminated. That meant there was more space which allowed diminutive technical midfielders who might previously have been bullied out of the game to flourish. Suddenly it became possible for the bigger teams, who were becoming relatively bigger than they ever had been before, to exercise greater control over games than ever before, to worry about manipulating space, Guardiola’s juego de posición, rather than having to scrap for midfield survival.
